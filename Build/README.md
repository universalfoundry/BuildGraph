# Universal Foundry Build

These BuildGraphs are intended as fully functional a starting point for running jobs on Universal Foundry. Please refer to the Universal Foundry documentation for more details.

## Quickstart

[Quickstart.xml](Quickstart.xml) is intended to be a fully functional example you can use to run jobs on Universal Foundry right away.

It contains two primary entry points that are automatically configured for use in Universal Foundry:

- `Build UGS PCBs for Horde`
- `BuildAndTest $(Project)`

## UGS

[UGS.xml](UGS.xml) handles building the Unreal Game Sync (UGS) installer and binaries.
